Who is this program for?

It is specifically targeted at new Debian and Fedora Linux users who may not know where to start with getting their systems running the bare necesseties for their use case.  For example, this program will detect whether your GPU is an AMD, Nvidia or Intel and give you the command to install the proper drivers for it.  Simply copy and paste the checkbox-generated Linux commands into your terminal after checking the corresponding checkbox.  

Experienced users may find it useful as a "quick and easy" way to get all of the basics installed as well.

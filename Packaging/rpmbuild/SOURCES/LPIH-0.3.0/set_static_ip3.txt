SETTING A STATIC IP IN THE GNOME DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT THROUGH THE GUI

Normally, your device's unique IP address is assigned dynamically, meaning it is not necessarily going to be the same every time it connects to your network. You can get a slightly more stable and performant connection by setting a static IP address, where your IP is the same every time it connects to the network. This will also aid in configuration of firewalls and servers since you can now specify your computer's connection by its exact IP address. Having a static IP can be useful for a multitude of reasons, one of them being the implementation of firewall rules. The instructions for switching to a static IP on Linux in the GNOME desktop environment are as follows:

1. Click in the top-right corner of the screen where the power icon is. Click the gear-shaped icon to access settings. You can also find the settings application icon by pressing the super key (Windows key or command key on Mac) and either find it visually or search settings in the search bar that pops up with the GNOME Activities window. This Activities window can also be accessed by clicking Activities in the top left of the screen.

2. If you are using Wi-Fi, click on Wi-Fi at the top of the scrollable menu on the left of the settings window. If you are using Ethernet, click on Network.

3. Click on the gear icon for the network connection you are using. Take note of the IP you are currently assigned in the IPv4 Address section of this window, under the Details tab. When you assign a static IP to your connection, you will make one that looks very similar to this one, save for the digits after the last decimal. So, if your IPv4 is currently 192.168.1.19, then you can likely assign yourself anything from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255, as long as the address is not in use by another network device.

4. Click the IPv4 tab, and change the method from Automatic (DHCP) to Manual.

5. In the address field, enter the static IP address you want to use.

6. Under Netmask, enter the subnet mask for your network. You can enter the ip addr show command to check which netmask to use. If you are using Wi-Fi, you will be looking for an interface that looks something like wlp32s0. Ethernet will look something like enp18s0. Beside the inet line for your interface in the terminal command output, there will be a slash followed by a number: this is the number of bits in your subnet mask.

Thus, inet 192.168.1.123/24 indicates a 24-bit netmask, which means 255.255.255.0 is your subnet mask.

- If it reads /16 then you will enter 255.255.0.0.
- For /8: 255.0.0.0
- For /24 (most common for residential networks): 255.255.255.0
- For /25: 255.255.255.128 and finally
- For /30 we have 255.255.255.252 for the subnet mask.

A subnet mask determines the size of a network: if more bits are available, then more devices can be connected.

7. Now we must determine the Gateway address, which is the address of your router. If you have accessed your router's admin tools from your browser before by typing in an IP address, this would be the same address; and it will generally be a similar IP sequence to what you have been dealing with, but with 1 as the only digit after the last decimal, like: XXX.XXX.X.1. So, if we are to keep with our 192.168.1.123 example, our gateway is most likely 192.168.1.1. However, we want to be sure of this. To confirm your gateway, use the ip route show command in the terminal. Look for the default via line with an IP beside it. This is your gateway address to enter. If you have difficulty determining your gateway, use the command:

ip route show | grep default

The output should contain the gateway address for your network after the words "default via."

8. Time to choose your DNS servers. You can pick whichever one you like. Cloudflare is popular with many since it offers security features like DDoS protection, SSL encryption, and a web application firewall. You can specify 2 addresses, in case one is down (separate them with a comma in the text field). To use Cloudflare as your DNS provider, you can use the addresses 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1. For added malware protection, substitute the last 1 in each address with a 2. OpenDNS is another popular provider that offers its own security features and malware protection, much like Cloudflare. To use OpenDNS, use 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220.

9. Save your new static IP address configuration with the Apply button. Go to your network settings and switch the connection off, then on again. Try to connect to a webpage. If it works, you are good to go. If not, you may have made an error in your IP configuration. If you need to go back to an automatically assigned IP you can undo the static IP settings by simply switching your connection from Manual to Automatic (DHCP) again in the settings.

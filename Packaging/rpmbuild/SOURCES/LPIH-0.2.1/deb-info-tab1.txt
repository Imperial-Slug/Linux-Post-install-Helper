      LINUX POST-INSTALL HELPER: DEBIAN		
   ======================================
   
   TO UNINSTALL LPIH.deb package: sudo apt remove lpih
   
This is a simple program geared towards helping new Debian and Fedora Linux GNOME users set up their systems following a fresh install. Eventually it will act as a singular, cohesive source of information that provides an auto-generated custom bash script unique to each user's unique use-case. It's currently not very impressive and in development, but it has the basic functionality of providing the user with the auto-generation of a series of Linux commands that will let them install specific packages for specific functionality if they are not sure where to start after installing their operating system.

HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM

Read through the series of checkboxes that come up after choosing your distro in the main menu window. Check them off if the described functionality is something you think you need on your system. For example, for those wishing to set up a gaming system that uses Steam, you may wish to check the "Steam" and "GPU drivers" checkboxes at a bare minimum.

As you check off these boxes, you will see some commands appear in the black window in green text. This text is meant to be copied and pasted into your terminal. You will need to agree to each package manager yes/no prompt as it executes.

Presently, you likely won't find this TIPS section overly helpful, as the focus so far has been on getting the core functionality of the application off the ground in a reasonably functional way.

INTRODUCTION TO DEBIAN LINUX

Debian GNU/Linux is one of the oldest and most popular Linux distributions, released in 1993. It is known for its stability and reliability, which is why it is often used for servers and other critical systems and serves as the base of many other distros, like Ubuntu and Linux Mint: Debian Edition (LMDE).

Debian, like other Linux distributions, has a package manager which handles the installation, updating, and removal of software packages on the computer. Debian's package manager is called "apt". In order to use some apt commands, the user must use the sudo command to elevate their privileges to those of a super-user. Example: sudo apt install nvidia-driver, where "nvidia-driver" is the package you are trying to install.

There are some instructions for optional basic system configuration outlined here that you might find useful, as well as some introductions to things that are different from Windows and MacOS in Linux that you will want to be aware of.
